Thanks for stopping by folks!

My name is Devesh Lohumi. 

I currently work as a Software Engineering Analyst at Goldman Sachs where I am a part of the Core Portfolio, Order and Trade Management platform team.

During my tenure, I have worked extensively on distributed systems, more specifically DbaaS (Database as a Service) and built end to end [reactive](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/) systems.

Prior to this, I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Manipal Institute of Technology.
